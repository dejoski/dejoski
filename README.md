# Dejan

Data and applied ML engineer working on production systems.

I design and build data platforms, analytics infrastructure, and AI-assisted tools that operate inside real environments. My work usually sits across pipelines, warehouses, internal products, and applied intelligence layers.

I focus on systems that are reliable, observable, and composable. If it cannot run unattended, be inspected end-to-end, and evolve without breaking downstream users, it is not finished.

## What I build

### Data and analytics systems

Multi-tenant ingestion and transformation pipelines  
Incremental processing frameworks and backfill tooling  
Warehouse modeling layers and metric foundations  
Client-level modeling and benchmarking systems  
Automated validation, QA, anomaly detection, and repair  
Infrastructure that supports BI, ML, and product surfaces

### Applied AI systems

LLM tools that operate on live schemas and datasets  
Agent systems tied to real workflows and permissions  
Reinforcement learning environments and training loops  
Evaluation, telemetry, and structured logging layers  
Sandboxed systems for production-safe experimentation

### Internal products

Analyst and engineer copilots  
DataOps-style automation platforms  
AI-assisted debugging and training environments  
Operational dashboards and control planes

Most projects are built to collapse manual decision loops into software.

## Stack and tooling

Python, SQL, TypeScript  
Databricks, Snowflake, PostgreSQL  
Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions  
Incremental pipelines, orchestration, warehouse design  
LLM systems, agent frameworks, RL training stacks  
Internal tools, APIs, and data-centric user interfaces

---

## Engineering principles

Production first  
Systems over scripts  
Observability before optimization  
AI as software, not artifacts  
Data systems are products

---

## Role focus

Data engineer  
Analytics engineer  
Applied ML or AI engineer  
Data platform engineer

I work best on teams building platforms, internal products, and data-driven systems where software, data, and intelligence intersect.
