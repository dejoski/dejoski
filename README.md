# Dejan

Data and applied ML engineer focused on production systems.

I build data platforms, analytics infrastructure, and AI-assisted tools that run inside real environments. Most of my work lives around pipelines, warehouses, internal tooling, and automation.

The problems I care about are reliability, observability, correctness, and leverage.

---

## Areas of work

Data engineering  
Analytics engineering  
Applied ML and LLM systems  
Internal tools and automation  
Experimentation and training systems

---

## What I build

### Data and analytics systems

Multi-tenant data pipelines  
Incremental processing frameworks  
Warehouse modeling layers  
Client-level benchmarking systems  
Automated validation, QA, and backfills  
Infrastructure that supports BI and downstream products

### Applied AI systems

LLM tools that operate on real schemas and databases  
Agent systems tied to production workflows  
Reinforcement learning environments and training loops  
Structured logging and evaluation layers  
Sandboxed systems for production-safe experimentation

### Internal products

Analyst and engineer copilots  
DataOps style automation platforms  
Debugging and training environments  
Monitoring and control dashboards

Most projects are designed to remove manual loops and turn repeated decisions into systems.

## Stack

Python, SQL, TypeScript  
Databricks, Snowflake, PostgreSQL  
Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions  
Warehouse design, incremental pipelines, orchestration  
LLM systems, agents, RL training pipelines  
Internal tools, APIs, data-centric UIs

---

## Engineering principles

Production first  
Systems over scripts  
Observability over assumptions  
AI as software, not demos  
Data systems are products

---

## Role focus

Data engineer  
Analytics engineer  
Applied ML or AI engineer  
Data platform engineer

I work best on teams building platforms, internal products, and data driven systems.
